### Description:
##### This project animates the eyes balls rolling as user can move the mouse cursor. This project demostrates it is possible to make objects react to the mouse move event, thereby introducing user interaction.  

### Future development:
##### 1) add a human face with nose, mouth etc.
##### 2) create a mouth that would change the mouth shape as the mouse cursor moves too, from laughter to smiling to being sad.
